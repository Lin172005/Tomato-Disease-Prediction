🍅 Tomato Leaf Disease Prediction

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to detect and classify tomato leaf diseases using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The model analyzes images of tomato leaves and predicts whether they are healthy or affected by diseases such as early blight, late blight, and bacterial spot.

🚀 Features

Image Classification: Uses a deep learning model to classify tomato leaf diseases.

Data Preprocessing: Includes image augmentation and normalization.

Model Training: Implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for accurate predictions.

Deployment: Can be deployed as a web app using Flask/Django or integrated into a mobile application.
